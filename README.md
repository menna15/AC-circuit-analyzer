# AC-circuits-solver
It's a CAD tool to simulate simple AC circuits that contains (independent voltage source,independent current source,
dependent voltage source,dependent current source,resistors, inductors and capacitors)  
calculates the voltage at all nodes, current in all branches and the power delivered or absorbed by each component.
