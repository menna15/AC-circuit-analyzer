# AC-circuits-solver
It's a CAD tool to simulate simple AC circuits that contains:
- independent voltage source
- independent current source
- dependent voltage source
- dependent current source
- resistors
- inductors 
- capacitors
## functionality:
calculates the voltage at all nodes, current in all branches and the power delivered or absorbed by each component.
